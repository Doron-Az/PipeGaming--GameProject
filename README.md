# PipeGaming -- Game Project

## Introduction

PipeGaming is a simple but challenging game project that tests your problem-solving skills. In this game, you need to connect pipes of various shapes and sizes to create a path for the liquid to flow from the source to the destination within a limited time. As you progress through the levels, the puzzles become increasingly difficult, requiring quick thinking and strategic planning.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive gameplay mechanics: Rotate the pipes to connect them and create a continuous path for the liquid to flow.
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty: The game features a series of levels, each with its own unique puzzle to solve.
- Randomly generated pipe layouts: Each level has a unique set of pipes and a randomly generated layout, ensuring that the game is always challenging and fun to play.
- Attractive graphics and sound effects: The game features colorful graphics and fun sound effects that enhance the player's experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with PipeGaming, you will need to download or clone the repository to your local machine. 

## How to Play

The objective of the game is to connect the pipes from the source to the destination within the time limit. To do this, you can rotate the pipes by clicking on them, and then connect them by clicking on the junctions between the pipes. You must create a continuous path for the liquid to flow from the source to the destination, without any leaks.

The game features two modes: timed mode and endless mode. In timed mode, you must complete the puzzle within a limited time. The time limit varies for each level and gets shorter as you progress through the game. In endless mode, there is no time limit, and you can play the game for as long as you like.
